		<h1>The Greatest Fact of All Time&hellip;</h1>
		<p>&hellip;is that Jesus Christ is the Creator of all things.</p>

		<p>The Bible, in chapter 1 of John&rsquo;s Gospel, says,</p>

		<blockquote class="scripture">
			<p><sup>1</sup> In the beginning was the <span class="highlight1">Word</span>, and the <span class="highlight1">Word</span> was with God, and the <span class="highlight1">Word</span> was God.</p>
			<p><sup>2</sup> The same was in the beginning with God.</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup> All things were made by Him; and without Him was not any thing made that was made.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>We learn here that the <span class="highlight1">Word</span> made all things&mdash;and that there was nothing the Word did not make.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="question">
		<div class="constraint">
			<p>But who is the &ldquo;Word&rdquo;?</p>

<section id="page3" class="page clearfix">
	<div class="constraint">
		<p>John 1:14 says:</p>
		<blockquote class="scripture">
			<p>And the <span class="highlight1">Word</span> was made <span class="highlight2">flesh</span>, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>So the <span class="highlight1">Word</span> had a body of <span class="highlight2">flesh</span>, and John says he saw Him. Again 1 John 1:1 speaks of Him:</p>
		<blockquote class="scripture">
			<p>That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the <span class="highlight1">Word</span> of life.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>It is clear that the Word is a man!</p>
	</div>
	<div class="question">
		<div class="constraint">
			<p>Who is this man?</p>
		</div>
	</div>
</section>

<section id="page4" class="page clearfix">
	<div class="constraint">
		<p>The <span class="highlight1">Word</span> can be none other than <strong>Jesus Christ</strong>!</p>
		<p>With this in mind, we read John 1 by substituting the name <em>Jesus Christ</em>!</p>

		<blockquote class="scripture">
			<p><sup>1</sup> In the beginning was <span class="highlight1">[Jesus Christ]</span>, and <span class="highlight1">[Jesus Christ]</span> was with God, and <span class="highlight1">[Jesus Christ]</span> was God.</p>
			<p><sup>2</sup> The same was in the beginning with God.</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup> All things were made by Him; and without Him was not any thing made that was made.</p>			
		</blockquote>

		<p>Yes, the greatest fact of all time is this: <strong>Jesus Christ is the Creator of the entire universe</strong>.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="question">
		<div class="constraint">
			<p>Why did Jesus Christ become a man?</p>
		</div>
	</div>
</section>

<section id="page5" class="page clearfix">
	<div class="constraint">
		<p>Jesus became a man because you and I have a problem. It is the same problem every person has&mdash;<strong>sin</strong>!</p>
		<p>The third chapter of Paul&rsquo;s letter to the Romans makes it very clear that we are all sinners.</p>

		<blockquote class="scripture">
			<p><sup>10</sup> There is <span class="highlight3">none</span> righteous, no, <span class="highlight3">not one</span>.</p>
			<p><sup>23</sup> <span class="highlight3">All</span> have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Yes, we are all guilty sinners. Then Romans 6:23 warns:</p>

		<blockquote class="scripture">
			<p>For the wages of sin is death&hellip;</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Since you have sinned, you have wages coming&mdash;death. This is both physical death and spiritual death. Spiritual death is eternal separation from God in hell.</p>

		<p>About hell Jesus said in Mark 9:44,</p>

		<blockquote class="scripture">
			<p>Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>These wages must be collected!</p>
	</div>
	<div class="question">
		<div class="constraint">
			<p>Is there any hope?</p>
		</div>
	</div>
</section>

<section id="page6" class="page clearfix">
	<div class="constraint">
		<p>There is hope! There is good news! Jesus received your wages. He died for your sin. He took your place. But He did something else very wonderful. When He died, He purchased a gift for you. The whole verse in Romans 6:23 reads:</p>

		<blockquote class="scripture">
			<p><span class="faded">For the wages of sin is death</span>; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Jesus Christ purchased a gift for you&mdash;eternal life!</p>
	</div>
	<div class="question">
		<div class="constraint">
			<p>How can I have this gift?</p>
		</div>
	</div>
</section>

<section id="page7" class="page">
	<div class="constraint">
		<p>Consider I John 5:9-10</p>

		<blockquote class="scripture">
			<p><sup>9</sup> If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: [if we believe what men say, then surely we can believe what God says because He is greater.] for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of His Son.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup> He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself. [In other words, he has the Holy Spirit. He knows he is a child of God.] He that believeth not God hath made Him a liar; (Why?) because he believeth not the record that God gave of His Son.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>If you don’t believe this record, you are actually calling God a liar.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="question">
		<div class="constraint">
			<p>What is the record you must believe?</p>
		</div>
	</div>
</section>

<section id="page8" class="page">
	<div class="constraint">
		<p>The record you must believe is found in I John 5:11.</p>

		<blockquote class="scripture">
			<p>And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>God has given you eternal life. It is a gift! He wants you to have it!</p>
		<p>But do you have it? Not necessarily! A gift must be received, and God&rsquo;s gift must be received!</p>
		<p>Let’s illustrate it like this:</p>
		<p>Suppose I offered you some money as a gift. If you did not receive my gift, you would not have it. You must receive it. In the same way you must receive God’s gift. If you do not receive His gift, you will never have it.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="question">
		<div class="constraint">
			<p>But how can you receive God’s gift?</p>
		</div>
	</div>
</section>



<section id="page9" class="page">
	<div class="constraint">
		<p>To illustrate, let me put the money in this booklet. The money represents eternal life and the booklet represents Jesus Christ the Son. When you receive the booklet, you get the money. When you receive Jesus Christ, you receive eternal life, because eternal life is in Jesus Christ.</p>
		<p>Let us read 1 John 5:11 again:</p>

		<blockquote class="scripture">
			<p>And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Eternal life is in Jesus Christ. Therefore, when you receive Jesus Christ, you have eternal life as stated in the next verse (I John 5:12)</p>

		<blockquote class="scripture">
			<p>He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.</p>
		</blockquote>

		
	</div>
	<div class="question">
		<div class="constraint">
			<p>But how can you have the Son?</p>
		</div>
	</div>
</section>

<section id="page10" class="page">
	<div class="constraint">
		<p>A very clear answer is found in Romans 10:9-10.</p>

		<blockquote class="scripture">
			<p><sup>9</sup> That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.</p>
			<p><sup>10</sup> For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>What does it mean to confess the Lord Jesus with your mouth? Perhaps it could be like this: “I will take Jesus as my Savior and Lord! I will trust Him for my salvation from sin.”</p>

		<p>Then believe with your heart (not just your head) that Jesus Christ lived and died for you; that He arose from the dead; that He is alive forevermore. He is not in a grave, or even on a cross, but alive and with the Father.</p>
		
	</div>
	<div class="question">
		<div class="constraint">
			<p>Then what?</p>
		</div>
	</div>
</section>

<section id="page11" class="page">
	<div class="constraint">
		<p>You will be saved!</p>
		<p>In other words, you will have the Son.</p>
		<p>You will have eternal life.</p>
		<p>So why not do this:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Repent and agree with God that you are a sinner.</li>
			<li>Confess Jesus Christ with your mouth as your Lord and Savior.</li>
			<li>Believe that He lives and that He was resurrected from the dead.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>And you will be saved!</p>
		<p>And here is the great offer!</p>

		<blockquote class="scripture">
			<p>For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</p>
			<p>&mdash;Romans 10:13<p>
		</blockquote>
		
		<p>In other words, if Jesus Christ were here, He might say to you, “If you will ask Me, I will save you from your sins, and I will give you eternal life.”</p>

		<p>Since Jesus Christ is God, He is here now!</p>
		
	</div>
	<div class="question">
		<div class="constraint">
			<p>But how can you call on Him? How can you receive Him?</p>
		</div>
	</div>
</section>

<section id="page12" class="page">
	<div class="constraint">
		<p>You can call on Him through prayer.</p>
		<p>You could talk to God like this:</p>
		<p><em>O God, I come to You in Jesus´name. I believe Your Word. I believe Jesus Christ lived and died for me, that He arose from the dead, that He is alive! And, Lord, I agree with You. I am a sinner; I am lost; I want to be saved. I call on you now with all my heart. Save me. For Jesus&rsquo; sake. Thank you, Lord, for saving me. In the name of Jesus I pray, Amen.</em></p>
		
		<p>Now the greatest fact of all time for you is this:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>You are a new creation of this wonderful Lord (2 Corinthians 5:17; Ephesians 2:10)</li>
			<li>You are a child of God (John 1:11-12; 3:3)</li>
			<li>You can know you have eternal life (1 John 5:13)</li>
			<li>You can come to Jesus Christ for forgiveness when you sin (1 John 1:9)</li>
			<li>He will never leave you nor forsake you (Hebrews 13:5b)</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Read the Word daily. Pray daily. Read the Gospel of John first.</p>
