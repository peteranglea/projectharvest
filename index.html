		<p>The Bible, in chapter 1 of John&rsquo;s Gospel, says,</p>

		<blockquote class="scripture">
			<p><sub>1</sub> In the beginning was the <span class="highlight1">Word</span>, and the <span class="highlight1">Word</span> was with God, and the <span class="highlight1">Word</span> was God. <sub>2</sub> He was in the beginning with God. <sub>3</sub> All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>We learn here that the <span class="highlight1">Word</span> made all things&mdash;and that there was nothing the Word did not make.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="question">
		<div class="constraint">
			<p>But who is the &ldquo;Word&rdquo;?</p>
		</div>
	</div>

<section id="page3" class="page">
	<div class="constraint">
		<p>John 1:14 says:</p>
		<blockquote class="scripture">
			<p>And the <span class="highlight1">Word</span> became <span class="highlight2">flesh</span> and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>So the <span class="highlight1">Word</span> had a body of <span class="highlight2">flesh</span>, and John says he saw Him. Again 1 John 1:1 speaks of Him:</p>
		<blockquote class="scripture">
			<p>That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we looked upon and have touched with our hands, concerning the <span class="highlight1">word</span> of life&hellip;</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>So, it's clear that the <span class="highlight1">Word</span> is a man!</p>
	</div>
	<div class="question">
		<div class="constraint">
			<p>Then who is this man?</p>
		</div>

<section id="page4" class="page">
	<div class="constraint">
		<p>The <span class="highlight1">Word</span> is none other than <strong>Jesus Christ</strong>!</p>
		<p>With this in mind, we can read John 1 and substitute the name <em>Jesus Christ</em>!</p>

		<blockquote class="scripture">
			<p><sub>1</sub> In the beginning was <span class="highlight1">[Jesus Christ]</span>, and <span class="highlight1">[Jesus Christ]</span> was with God, and <span class="highlight1">[Jesus Christ]</span> was God. <sub>2</sub> He was in the beginning with God. <sub>3</sub> All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.</p>

		<p>Yes, the greatest fact of all time is this: <strong>Jesus Christ is the Creator of the entire universe</strong>.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="question">
		<div class="constraint">
			<p>But why did Jesus Christ become a man?</p>
		</div>
	</div>
</section>

<section id="page5" class="page">
	<div class="constraint">
		<p>Jesus became a man because you and I have a problem. It is the same problem every person has&mdash;<strong>sin</strong>!</p>
		<p>The third chapter of the apostle Paul&rsquo;s letter to the Romans makes it very clear that we are all sinners.</p>

		<blockquote class="scripture">
			<p><sup>10</sup> &hellip;<span class="highlight3">None</span> is righteous, no, <span class="highlight3">not one</span>&hellip;</p>
			<p><sup>23</sup> for <span class="highlight3">all</span> have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Yes, we are all guilty sinners. Then Romans 6:23 warns:</p>

		<blockquote class="scripture">
			<p>For the wages of sin is death&hellip;</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Since you and I have sinned, we have wages coming&mdash;death. This is both physical death and spiritual death. Spiritual death is eternal separation from God in hell.</p>

		<p>About hell Jesus said in Mark 9:48,</p>

		<blockquote class="scripture">
			<p>&hellip;where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>These wages must be collected!</p>
	</div>
	<div class="question">
		<div class="constraint">
			<p>Is there any hope?</p>
		</div>
	</div>
</section>

<section id="page6" class="page">
	<div class="constraint">
		<p>Yes! There is hope! There is good news! Jesus received your wages. He died for your sin. He took your place. But He did something else very wonderful. When He died, He purchased a gift for you. The whole verse in Romans 6:23 reads:</p>

		<blockquote class="scripture">
			<p><span class="faded">For the wages of sin is death</span>; but the free gift of God is <span class="highlight5">eternal life</span> in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Jesus Christ purchased a gift for you&mdash;<span class="highlight5">eternal life!</span></p>
	</div>
	<div class="question">
		<div class="constraint">
			<p>How can I have this gift?</p>
		</div>
	</div>
</section>

<section id="page7" class="page">
	<div class="constraint">
		<p>Consider 1 John 5:9&ndash;10</p>

		<blockquote class="scripture">
			<p><sub>9</sub> If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater, for this is the testimony of God that he has borne concerning his Son. <sub>10</sub> Whoever believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. Whoever does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has borne concerning his Son.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>If you don’t believe this testimony, you are actually calling God a liar.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="question">
		<div class="constraint">
			<p>What is this &ldquo;testimony&rdquo; I must believe?</p>
		</div>
	</div>
</section>

<section id="page8" class="page">
	<div class="constraint">
		<p>The testimony you must believe is found in 1 John 5:11.</p>

		<blockquote class="scripture">
			<p>And this is the testimony, that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>God has given you eternal life. It is a gift! He wants you to have it!</p>
		<p>But do you have it? Not necessarily! A gift must be received, and God&rsquo;s gift must be received!</p>
		<p>Let’s illustrate it like this:</p>
		<p>Suppose I offered you some money as a gift. If you don&rsquo;t receive my gift, you won&rsquo;t have it. You must receive it. In the same way you must receive God’s gift. If you do not receive His gift, you will never have it.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="question">
		<div class="constraint">
			<p>How can I receive God’s gift?</p>
		</div>
	</div>
</section>



<section id="page9" class="page">
	<div class="constraint">
		<p>To illustrate, let's suppose I put the money in a bank account. The money represents eternal life and the bank account represents Jesus Christ. If I transfer the bank account to you, you get the money. When you receive Jesus Christ, you receive eternal life, because eternal life is in Jesus Christ.</p>
		<p>Let&rsquo;s read 1 John 5:11 again:</p>

		<blockquote class="scripture">
			<p>And this is the testimony, that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Eternal life is in Jesus Christ. Therefore, when you receive Jesus Christ, you have eternal life as stated in the next verse (1 John 5:12)</p>

		<blockquote class="scripture">
			<p>Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.</p>
		</blockquote>

	<div class="question">
		<div class="constraint">
			<p>How do I receive Jesus Christ?</p>

<section id="page10" class="page">
	<div class="constraint">
		<p>A very clear answer is found in Romans 10:9-10.</p>

		<blockquote class="scripture">
			<p><sub>9</sub> &hellip;if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. <sub>10</sub> for with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>What does it mean to confess the Lord Jesus with your mouth? Perhaps it could be like this: <em>&ldquo;I will take Jesus as my Savior and Lord! I will trust Him for my salvation from sin.&rdquo;</em></p>

		<p>Then believe with your heart (not just your head) that Jesus Christ lived and died for you, that He arose from the dead, and that He is alive forevermore. He is not in a grave, or even on a cross, but alive and with God the Father.</p>
		
	</div>
	<div class="question">
		<div class="constraint">
			<p>Then what?</p>
		</div>
	</div>
</section>

<section id="page11" class="page">
	<div class="constraint">
		<p>You will be saved!</p>
		<p>In other words, you will have the Jesus&mdash;<em>you will have eternal life.</em></p>
		<p>So why not do this:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Repent and agree with God that you are a sinner.</li>
			<li>Confess Jesus Christ with your mouth as your Lord and Savior.</li>
			<li>Believe that He lives and that He was resurrected from the dead.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>And you will be saved!</p>
		<p>And here is the great offer!</p>

		<blockquote class="scripture">
			<p>For &ldquo;everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&mdash;Romans 10:13<p>
		</blockquote>
		
		<p>In other words, if Jesus Christ were here, He might say to you, <em>&ldquo;If you will ask Me, I will save you from your sins, and I will give you eternal life.&rdquo;</em></p>

		<p>Since Jesus Christ is God, He is here now!</p>
		
	</div>
	<div class="question">
		<div class="constraint">
			<p>How can I call on Him? How can I receive Him?</p>
		</div>
	</div>
</section>

<section id="page12" class="page">
	<div class="constraint">
		<p>You can call on Him through prayer. You could talk to God like this:</p>
		<blockquote class="prayer">
			<p>O God, I come to You in Jesus&rsquo; name. I believe Your Word. I believe Jesus Christ lived and died for me, that He arose from the dead, that He is alive! And, Lord, I agree with You. I am a sinner; I am lost; I want to be saved. I call on you now with all my heart. Save me. For Jesus&rsquo; sake. Thank you, Lord, for saving me. In the name of Jesus I pray, Amen.</p>
